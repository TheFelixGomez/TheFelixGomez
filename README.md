### Hi there 👋, I'm Felix!

I'm a Mechatronics Engineer from Colombia.

🔭 I'm currently working on building websites, APIs, and as a consultant around the world.

:heart: I like to build software, augment the reality, and create DL/ML algorithms to improve our life quality.

## ⚡Fun fact:
You will usually find me taking a new course, learning a new language, attempting to master a new instrument, or playing Video Games :video_game:.
